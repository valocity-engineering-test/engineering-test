// Summary:
// Overall, a solid start. The logic is generally sound, but there are areas for improvement, particularly around typos, clarity, and bugs. 
// A major area to address is the inconsistency between DateTime and DateTimeOffset. Consider changing all DOB references to use DateTime for consistency and to avoid potential issues with date calculations.
// Consider removing or refining comments that state obvious information to better code readability such as "Creates a dandon Name", "Adds new people to the list" and "Dont think this should ever happen".
// Additionally, revisit XML comments to ensure they provide meaningful documentation, as MaxItemsToRetrieve is not actually used in the code, and GetPeoples does not return List<object> as stated or provide any additional useful information.
// Refer to the comments for specific suggestions on how to enhance code quality and maintainability.
